## Postman

To get started quickly you can import the example [Postman Collection Config](./postman-collection-config.json) to test the API.

In the collection's variables, set your current value for `api_key` and `api_secret`.

See the collection's `Pre-request Script` for an example of how to generate the `X-Signature` and `X-Timestamp` headers.
